      <h3>HTML is like a home's structure</h3>
      <p>Web page developers depend on standard, tried-and-true parts for the layout of web pages, similar to the way builders depend on parts and materials to construct houses.</p>
      <p>HyperText Markup Language's "block" level components and semantic elements can be viewed as similar to the beams, bars, walls and floors that make a residence physically stable and structurally sound.</p>

      <h3>CSS is like a home's decor</h3>
      <p>Once a web page's structure is intact, web designers can focus on interior decoration, so to speak.</p>
      <p>Cascading Stylesheets allow designers to establish efficient rules and preferences that are similar to the design choices that give a home its look, feel, and appeal. Good design plays a big role in good user experience (UX) .</p>

      <h3>JavaScript is like a home's appliances</h3>
      <p>For anyone to live and operate within a home, numerous things in the home have to <em>work</em> when used.</p>
      <p>JavaScript's "events" are similar to what happens when people flip a switch, i.e. does the light go on or off as expected? Does the oven work? Does the air conditioner work? How about the sink? Web developers use JavaScript to determine how a website will function and to guide user interaction (UI).</p>

      <h3>Content is like a home's family</h3>
      <p>Just as the purpose of a home is to house real people, the purpose of a website is to house relevant content.</p>
      <p>Information, media, data and meaning are the real reason why users visit a website, plus return to it or share it with others. The content that <em>lives</em> on a site is arguably the most important element of all.</p>
