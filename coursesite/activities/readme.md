# Week 3

## A. Refrigerator Magnets
How would you rearrange these _semantic_ HTML tags to make a well-structured article page?

|...|...|...|...|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|`<article>`|`<aside>`|`<body>`|`<div>`|
|`<figure>`|`<footer>`|`<h1>`|`<h2>`|
|`<head>`|`<header>`|`<html>`|`<iframe>`|
|`<img>`|`<link>`|`<main>`|`<meta>`|
|`<p>`|`<section>`|`<table>`|`<title>`|

### Hints
- Some are required and some are optional.
- Some can be used once while others can be used repeatedly.

## B. Edit Team and Design Team
Pair up and role play. One person is the head of the editorial team and the other person is the head of the design/development team. The editorial person explains their vision for the content template. The design person codes it up, based on that vision.

## B. Examine _data journalism_ job descriptions
Google has a job listing service that you can get to by using "...jobs" with any search phrase, i.e. "data journalism jobs". Do a few searches for phrases such as:
- data journalist jobs
- digital storytelling jobs
- newsroom developer jobs
- _think of similar ones_

Read over the requirements and make note of common skills that stand out to you. Run similar searches via Indeed, LinkedIn and elsewhere. Be prepared to discuss.
