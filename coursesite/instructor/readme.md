__I've spent most of my career as a technologist in newsrooms and now I teach technology to news students.__

I worked for many years as a web content producer with various news outlets including TIME.com and MSN, then worked on the data desk at Crain's New York Business. I was also News Editor at Black Enterprise and Brooklyn Bureau Reporter at Large for City Limits. My current work at NYU involves interactive content production and data visualization.

I earned my MS from Pace University in New York City as part of its Publishing program and I earned my BA from Morehouse College in Atlanta as an English major and Linguistics minor.
