__I've spent most of my career as a technologist in newsrooms and now I do that in academic environments.__

I work with NYU IT and with CUNY Grad School of Journalism. I worked for many years as a web content producer with various news outlets including TIME.com, then worked on the data desk at Crain's New York Business. My current work in higher ed involves instructional technology, interactive content production, plus data visualization.

I earned my MS from Pace University in New York City as part of its Publishing program and I earned my BA from Morehouse College in Atlanta as an English major and Linguistics minor.
