# Setup Github Repos

__You must setup a Github Repository so that you can showcase the functioning versions of your work__

## Follow these steps
1. If you haven't already done so, create a free [Github](https://github.com/) account.
2. Be aware that all work uploaded to Github is viewable by the public unless you get private status, which is available for free to students and educators. As a student, you are protected under FERPA law and you have the right to keep your work private. So to take advantage of Github's private account status, [apply to get student status](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) associated with your account. Read CUNY's FERPA statement.
3. Create a new "repository" for this assignment.
4. Once you are satisfied with the work you have completed on your computer, upload your project files to the Github repository.
5. Your work will appear under the "Code" section of your repository. Using Github's editing features, you can continue to tweak your code right in the app, however, this version will now be the most up to date, not the version on your computer.

## Turn it in
When you "turn in" your assignments, you need to copy the full URL of its index.html file and paste it into Github's HTML Preview tool to generate a viewable version, which you'll then share with me via a Slack DM with me.

Here's how:
- Preview how your work will appear to me by entering the full URL of its index.html file into [Github's HTML Preview tool](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).
- The Preview URL will be the one that you copy paste into a Slack DM with me. That's when I'll consider your assignment "turned in".
