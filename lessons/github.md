# Setup Github Repos

__You must setup a Github Repository so that you can showcase the functioning versions of your work__

When you "turn in" your assignments, you need to copy the full URL of its index.html file and paste it into Github's HTML Preview tool to generate a viewable version, which you'll then share with me via a Slack DM with me.

Follow these steps:

- You will submit files for this assignment using Github, so if you haven't already done so, you must create a free Github account.
- Be aware that all work uploaded to Github is viewable by the public unless you get private status, which is available for free to students and educators. To take advantage of private repositories, apply to have student status associated with your Github account.
- Create a new "repository" for this assignment.
- Once you are satisfied with the work you have completed on your computer, upload your project files to the Github repository.
- Your work will appear under the "Code" section of your repository. Using Github's editing features, you can continue to tweak your code right in the app, however, these updates would now be the most up to date.
- Preview how your work will appear to me by entering its index.html file's full URL to [Github's HTML Preview tool](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).
- This will be the URL that you copy paste into a Slack DM with me.
