# Data Analysis

Imagine that you report on the education beat and your audience includes lots of working parents. As they plan financially for their child's college years, they rely heavily on the accuracy of your reporting.

You've learned that you have to know how to ask questions in ways that can be answered by data and you've also learned to recognize when additional will be needed to get those answers. Ultimately, you answer analytical questions so you can add context to your reporting and direction to your story.

Examine the data in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5IXGd1vdzRHjtg18ntcmOTSobp0BnXzgTT8tswfCIU/edit?usp=sharing). It includes details about colleges and universities in the Tri-State region.

Make a copy of it for your own use and use functions and formulas to answer the following:
1. Which school (per state) had the highest Total Cost in 2017? In 2002?
2. Multiply 2016 enrollment figures by 2016 Total Costs to determine how much money each school received from students (hint: you can reference cells between sheets).
3. What percentage of a student's Total Cost is for Room and Board?
4. What was the median cost for Books and Supplies?
5. By what percentage did each school's Tuition and Fees change from 2012 to 2016 (and which changed dramatically)?

__BONUS:__ think of two additional questions that will be important to your story angle and try answering them with this dataset.
