## What's the most?
To find the greatest or highest value, use the `=MAX()` function, which returns the maximum value in a given range of numeric data cells.

|Example|
|:--|
|`=MAX(A3,A5,A8,A9...)`|

## What's the least?
To find the smallest or lowest value, use the `=MIN()` function.


## How does that rank?
To find a value's position among a hierarchy, use the `=RANK()` function.
