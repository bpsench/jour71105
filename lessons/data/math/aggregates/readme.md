# Aggregate Functions

In the world of data analysis, people run "aggregate functions" to add up or group together or tally or sort a large number of values to ultimately get a new value that answers a question or provides some meaning about all the values.

As you research, you'll think of certain questions (or your editor will ask you certain questions) and you'll need smart ways of getting the answers. With data at your disposal, you can use _aggregates_ to respond to the following.

|Question type|Function type|
|:--|:--|
|How many...|`=COUNT()`|
|How much...|`=SUM()`|
|What's the most... What's the highest...|`=MAX()`|
|What's the least... What's the lowest...|`=MIN()`|
|How does this rank?|`=RANK()`|
