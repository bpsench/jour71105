# Math
__What role does math play in journalism?__

Reporters, columnists, fact checkers and copyeditors use math very regularly to convey impact, context and scale in their storytelling. Most rely on Algebra and Statistics for number crunching, yet even basic arithmetic can help tremendously in including helpful numbers in a story.

Similar to how exact quotes, correct grammar and overall accuracy are tied to your journalistic integrity... so are precise numbers! Your ability to use math well is right up there with the other fundamentals.

## Tips
Writing well about numbers is also key. Similar to a nut graf, many articles -- news and opinion alike -- include what we might call a *math graf*.
