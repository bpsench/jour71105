# Mode
Mode is useful when you need to find a numeric value that occurs frequently in a dataset.

There is not a math formula for mode, however, there is a built-in function in your spreadsheet tool.

## Function
`=MODE(A2:A11)`

## Practice
Use averaging functions to answer the following:
- What is the average gas price?
- Which gas price falls in the middle?
- What is the most frequently occurring gas price?

|City|Price|
|:--|--:|
|Anchorage|2.08|
|Austin|2.29|
|Chicago|2.51|
|Dallas|2.29|
|Denver|2.38|
|Honolulu|3.06|
|Houston|2.29|
|Los Angeles|2.73|
|Miami|2.64|
|New York City|2.98|
|San Juan|5.97|
|Washington DC|2.89|

### Tip
The `=MODE()` function only works on numeric data. If, for instance, you wanted to analyze public opinion polls, you'd want to learn which text-formatted response occurred most, such as "First-time voter" or "Strongly Disagree". You would need to combine a few tricks, which are best described in this article from Exceljet:
