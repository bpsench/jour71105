# Mode
Mode is useful when you need to find a numeric value that occurs frequently in a dataset.

There is not a math formula for mode, however, there is a built-in function for it in your spreadsheet tool.

## Function
`=MODE(A2:A11)`

## Practice
Use `=MODE()` to find the most frequently occurring gas price.

You would need to combine a few tricks, which are best described in this article from Exceljet:
