# Averages

In contrast to aggregates, which tell you what the extreme values are, averages tell us more about what values are typical. Averages help you detect patterns or find trends. You calculate an average to get a sense of what statisticians call _measures of central tendency_.

## Types
Why are there different types of averages and when should you each?

|Question type|Function type|
|:--|:--|
|What's the average number?|`=AVERAGE()`|
|What number is right in the middle?|`=MEDIAN()`|
|What number occurs most?|`=MODE()`|

### Keywords
| Mean | Median | Mode |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Mathematical | Middle | Most |

### Caveats
|Mean|Median|Mode|
|:--|:--|:--|
|The resulting figure can be an unreal number|An even number of data points requires averaging the two middle figures|There can be more than one mode, or sometimes no mode|

### Best Practice
Calculate all three, then evaluate which result is most relevant to the story you're reporting.
