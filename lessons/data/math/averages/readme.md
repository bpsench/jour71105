# Averages

In contrast to aggregates, which tell you what the extreme values are, averages tell us more about what values are typical. Averages help you detect patterns or find trends. You calculate an average to get a sense of what the statisticians call _measures of central tendency_.

Why are there different types of averages and when should you each?
