# Averages
In contrast to aggregates, which tell you what the extreme values are, averages tell us more about values that are typical. Averages help you detect patterns and find trends. You calculate averages to get a sense of what statisticians call _measures of central tendency_.

## Types
There are different kinds of averages and different cases for using each, depending on what question you want to answer.

|Question type|Function type|
|:--|:--|
|What's the average number?|__Mean__|
|What number is right in the middle?|__Median__|
|What number occurs most?|__Mode__|

### They each have special powers

### Best Practice
Calculate all three, then evaluate which result is most relevant to the story you're reporting.
