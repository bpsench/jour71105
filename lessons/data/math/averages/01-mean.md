# Mean
This is what most folks mean when they say the "average", however, this type of average only works well when working with numbers that are of very similar value and in a relatively tight range. The mean can skew unreliably when the range of figures includes one or more outliers.

__Calculate the mean by adding all the values in a range and dividing the sum by the total number of values.__

The mean is the only average calculated mathematically. The resulting figure will be a number, however, it'll very often be an unreal number, not an actual number from among the list and it typically includes decimal digits. Spreadsheet tools also include a function that does the work.


## Formula
`=SUM(A1:A11)/10`

## Function
`=AVERAGE(A1:A11)`

### Note
The `=AVERAGE()` function does the same job as the mathematical approach achievable with the `=SUM()` and the division operator `/`.

- What is the figure you calculated for the average?
- Is this figure representative of all the values?
- Why or why not?
