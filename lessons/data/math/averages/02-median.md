# Median
Median is the most reliable way to evaluate tendency among diverse values because it does not skew when outlier values are present. Median is used more often than mean in the calculation of things like most typical home prices or most representative worker salaries, because unusually high or low figures on the scale won't greatly impact the result.

There is not a single formula for median because it is calculated by sorting all values in a column and identifying the one that falls in the middle. To determine the median in a column with an even number of values, take the two values in the middle and perform a mean/average on just those two figures to get the mean.

Or, using a spreadsheet tool, enter the following function:

`=MEDIAN(A2:A11)`
