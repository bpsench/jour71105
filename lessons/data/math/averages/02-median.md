# Median
Median is the most reliable way to evaluate tendency among diverse values because it does not skew when outlier values are present. Median is used more often than mean in the calculation of things like most typical home prices or most representative worker salaries, because unusually high or low figures on the scale won't greatly impact the result.

Without the help of a spreadsheet tool, the median would have to be calculated manually. It is reached by sorting all values in ascending or descending order, then determining which value falls right in the middle of the entire list of values. That'll be a real number from among the list if there is an odd number of figures. For an even number of figures, you take the mean of the middle two.

Or, using a spreadsheet tool, enter the following function:

`=MEDIAN(A2:A11)`
