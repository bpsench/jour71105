# Percent
A percent is understood to be part of a whole, some distinguishable amount of a complete unit. The unit is represented as `100` and all portions within it are fractions of the full 100 percent.

Readers and viewers can grasp the idea of *parts of a whole* far better than they can make sense of raw numbers that don't have context.

One percent equals one hundredth.
