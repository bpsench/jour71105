# Percentile
Use percentile in the real world to demonstrate how any given place on a scale, such as a test score, compares to other scores.

For instance, if a student got 93 on an exam, they might think they did great. However, if they learn that 8 of the other 10 students got between 95 and 98, then they'll realize they didn't fair so great, in comparison to the others. Their percentile score would be pretty low.

__To calculate percentile, take the number of people at a given score point and divide by the total number of people__

Percentile is also used to evaluate qualities, such as height. Are you tall or are you short? It depends who you're being compared to. A kid who is considered tall among his or her second grade classmates is not still considered tall among most other people. So while they might be in the 99th percentile at school, they could be in the 39th percentile at home.

And by some measures, a mid-range percentile could be ideal. For instance, when it's used to evaluate weight. Healthy weight is considered neither overweight or underweight, but somewhere in between.
