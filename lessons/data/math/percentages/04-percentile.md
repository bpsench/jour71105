# Percentile
Use percentile in the real world to demonstrate how any given place on a scale, such as a test score, compares to other scores.

So for instance, if a student got 93 on an exam, they might think they did great. However, if they learn that 8 of the other 10 students got between 95 and 98, then they'll realize they didn't fair so great, in comparison to the others. Their percentile score would be pretty low.
