# Percentile
Use percentile in the real world to demonstrate how any given place on a scale, such as a test score, compares to other scores.

For instance, if a student got 93 on an exam, they might think they did great. However, if they learn that 8 of the other 10 students got between 95 and 98, then they'll realize they didn't fair so great, in comparison to the others. Their percentile score would be pretty low.

## To calculate percentile
- Start by sorting all values in a data set from lowest to highest (later you will count up from the bottom).
- Then multiply the total number of values by the desired percentile value. For instance, to determine where the 90th percentile is among 25 scores, multiply 25 * 0.9 to get 22.5 (this product is called the index).
- Round up the decimal points to get the nearest whole number, i.e. 23. From the lowest value in the data set, count up to the 23rd value, that'll be the 90th percentile.

Percentile is also used to evaluate qualities, such as height. Are you tall or are you short? It depends who you're being compared to. A kid who is considered tall among his or her second grade classmates is not still considered tall among most other people. So while they might be in the 95th percentile at school, they could be in the 25th percentile at home.

And by some measures, a mid-range percentile could be ideal. For instance, when it's used to evaluate weight. Healthy weight is considered neither overweight or underweight, but the range in between.
