# Percentage Points

Percentage points can be tricky because they might not explain the whole story. They also require a good understanding of the two previous types of percentages to be used effectively.

Use percentage points to convey relationships between the part and the whole.

For instance, if last month's unemployment rate was 5.4% and this month's rate is 7.2%, it rose by 1.8 percentage points, but by what actual percentage?

Refer back to what you just learned in the [Percent Change lesson](02-percent-change.md), regarding how to calculate change over time.

Conversely, if the 5.4% unemployment rate went down by 1.8 percentage points to 3.6%, then by how much would it have dropped, percentage-wise?
