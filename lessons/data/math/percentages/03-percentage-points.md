# Percentage Points

Percentage points can be tricky because they might not explain the whole story. They also require a good understanding of the two previous types of percentages to be used effectively.

Use percentage points to convey relationships between the part and the whole.

## Exercise
For instance, if last month's unemployment rate was 5.4% and this month's rate is 7.2%, it rose by 1.8 percentage points, but by what actual percentage?

Refer back to the equations you just learned in the [Percent Change lesson](02-percent-change.md), regarding how to calculate change over time.

Conversely, if the 5.4% unemployment rate went down by 1.8 percentage points to 3.6%, then by how much would it have dropped, percentage-wise?

### Answer to that brain teaser
25 is a third of 75, so if the graduation rate increased to 100%, then the previous rate of 75% increased by a third of its own value, i.e. by 33%.
