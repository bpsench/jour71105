Percent change, also called percentage increase and decrease, is the amount a given number gains or loses value when compared to a comparable number, typically measured over time.

__To calculate percent change__
1. Subtract the new figure from the old figure
2. Then divide that result by the old figure
3. Multiply by 100 to get x%

__Sorthand__
```
New minus Old
over Old
times 100
```

Percent increase will be a positive figure.
Percent decrease will be a negative figure.
