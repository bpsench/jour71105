# Rates and Populations
Use rates to compare different sized groups on a fair scale. In journalism, rates are frequently used to compare crime rates and similar socio-demographic data.

It's not enough to say that one city has more reported crimes than another city has and therefore the former city must be a more dangerous place than the latter. To be fair, you have to account for the population of each city before you draw any conclusion. To be fair, you need to know how many crimes there were per person (per capita) and proportionally, per 100,000 people.

__To calculate rate between two populations, get each per capita figure, then multiply them by a population figure that both have in common, i.e. `1,000` or `10,000`. For large U.S. cities, this is typically measured at `100,000` people.__
