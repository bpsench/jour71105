# Hyperlinks
__Page to page linking is the functionality that makes the web the web.__

A page _anchor_ (written using the `<a>` tag, does all the work of what's referred to as _hyperlinking_. The name attribute, (written using `<a name="#">`) lets a page developer add links within a long document, while a hyperlink reference (written using `<a href="#">`) lets a developer redirect the user over to other pages of the website or out to other sites.
