# Hyperlinks
__Page to page linking is the functionality that makes the web the web.__

A page _anchor_ (written using the `<a>` tag, does all the work of what's referred to as _hyperlinking_.

- The `<a>` tag's most commonly used _attribute_ is the __hyperlink reference__ or `href` for short. It lets a you point users to other pages of the current website or direct them out to another web site.
- The __target__ attribute lets you control where the link that's being referred to will load and display, for instance, in a new browser window.

## Syntax

|Opening tag|Attribute property|Attribute value|Attribute property|Attribute value|Content|Closing tag|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|`<a`|`href=`|`"https://journalism.cuny.edu/"`|`target=`|`"_blank">`|Newmark J School|`</a>`|

## In action
```html
<a href="https://journalism.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">Newmark J School</a>
```

## Tips
- Use linked text to describe clearly what you're linking to.
- Avoid linking phrases such as "Click here" because it's bad for accessibility readers and for search engines.

## Challenge
1. How would you use linking to create a navigation menu?
2. How would you make an image in one page link to another web page?
