# Hyperlinks
Web page to web page linking is the functionality that makes the web the web.

A named page anchor (written using `<a name="#">`) lets a page developer add links within a long document, while a hyperlink reference (written using `<a href="#">`) lets a developer redirect the user over to other pages of the website or out to other sites.
