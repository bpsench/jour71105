# Text
__Written content is best handled by the paragraph tag `<p>`__

The `<p>` tag is a _block-level_ element that can contain various text formatting tags, such as:

- `<em>` for emphasized or italicized text
- `<strong>` for strongly typed or bolded text
- `<mark>` for specially marked or highlighted text
