# Embedded content

You can use your web page to display content from another resource on the web by embedding it in an _inline frame_, or `<iframe>`.

If you know the URL and dimensions and other particulars about the source material you'll embed, then you can follow iframe syntax rules to fill in details for the tag's attributes. However, many services, such as social media networks, that allow you to embed their content will likely provide the iframe code and might even allow you to customize that code for your purposes. Your task is to copy the code they provide and then paste it into any area of your web page that you designate.

## Challenge
1. test all of the attributes of the iframe tag
2. Embed the following in your practice web page:
- A tweet
- An Instagram post
- A YouTube video
- Soundcloud audio
- A Google Maps example
- A Google Drive Slides presentation
