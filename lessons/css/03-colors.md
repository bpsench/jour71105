# Colors
Computer monitor colors display combinations of red, green, and blue light values to render what our human eyes perceive as colors. CSS accepts basic colors by name (i.e. purple, brown, pink) but to get much more exact tones, designers use coded combinations, known as hexidecimal values, which represent many variations of red, green and blue light levels.
